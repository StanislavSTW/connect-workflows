# Subscription Suspension
## Description
This transition indicates that a suspend request was created and approved. Therefore, the system suspends an activated subscription and assigns *Suspended* status to it. 
Note that suspend requests are available in case the **Administrative Hold** capability is enabled. Refer to the [Connect community portal](https://connect.cloudblue.com/community/modules/products/capabilities/) to learn more about capability attributes.
