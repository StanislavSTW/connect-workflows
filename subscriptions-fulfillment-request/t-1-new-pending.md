# Pending Request Creation
## Description
This transition indicates that a buyer generates a new pending fulfillment request. Thereafter, this request can be approved or rejected by Vendors. Alternatively, in case parameter value should be specified, the system assigns the request to the *Inquiring* status. Furthermore, in case tier parameter data should be specified, the Connect platform assigns it to the *Tiers Setup* state.
## Prerequisites
A listed product and an active distribution contract are required to generate a new pending fulfillment request.
## Operation results
A new fulfillment request with the [Pending](s-b-pending.html) status is created as a result of this operation.
